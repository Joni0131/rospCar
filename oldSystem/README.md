# 1. Old System

The initial RC car is controlled with a RX-C2 controller that is controlling both motors.
The steering motor is a FA-130 motor and has an operation range of 1.5-3.0 V.
The power motor has the marking 260s-18130-38. This corresponds to a voltage range of ...
When analysing the PCB for the steering motor it is getting wierd.
The following schematic shows the actual connections of the steering motor to the power, ground and the IC controller.
It is clear that connection the motor is connected to the base of the resistor. Eventhough this is not normaly the case.
The only possiblities for this error is either I found the wrong datasheet or i am analysing the pcb incorrectly.
Here is the back and front side of the pcb.
