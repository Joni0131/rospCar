# 4. Brain

## 4.1 Requirements

- The Brain is using ROS2 to communicate with the ESP
- The Brain sends controll instructions to the ESP
- The Brain is collecting and processing the sensor data.

Later:
- The Brain is using the sensor data to derive the controll instructions
- The Brain is using a SLAM algorithm.
